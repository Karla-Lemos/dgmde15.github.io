Our first session will be spent investigating the question: Why do people code? We will spend out time • getting a sense of the people in the room and why *we* want to code • getting our machines set up with [the tools we’ll need](tools-and-materials) to work throughout the semester • taking our first stab at building something using HTML, CSS, and Javascript by designing our own digital business card to live on [the people page](people) of our course site with information about who we are.

For next week, we hope you'll have made it through the following steps:

-   Set up up your local development environment by [the steps here](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/ec3e2f68b9ab8b2614a1) - this is the process we began in the first class session.
-   Make sure that you have *forked* the [class website repo](https://github.com/dgmde15/dgmde15.github.io) to your own Github account. More info on how to fork can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) with a video walkthrough [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jGUFpWYm60).
-   Once you have forked the class website repo, *clone* a copy to your computer so you can run a local version of the site and make changes to the site files. Instructions for this are part of [the steps here](https://gist.github.com/aresnick/ec3e2f68b9ab8b2614a1). You should be able to open Google Chrome, navigate to `http://localhost:4000` and see the course site pages (and any changes you may make to them).
-   After following the above steps, you are prepared to contribute to the site! During next week's session we'll walk through the process of adding yourself to the [`/people`](http://dgmde15.github.io/people/) page on the course website.
-   If you want to go ahead with the next steps: you'll be modifying the `people/index.html` file by adding a `div` element with an `id` specific to your name. Then, you'll modify the `assets/css/people.css` file and add styling to your `id`. You can use the existing code as as a template.
-   Participate in the [Discourse forum](http://dgmde15.github.io/forum) conversation by posting projects that inspire you, or starting a new topic!
