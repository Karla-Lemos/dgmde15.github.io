Our class sessions will be hosted in Room 202 of <a href='http://map.harvard.edu/?bld=02121&level=9'>One Brattle Square</a>.  The simplest entry is to go into the street level entrance to the Easter Mountain Sports, go up the escalators, and then take a right, entering into Harvard's space on the second floor.  Room 202 is in the back-left of the floor.
